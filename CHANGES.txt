0.10.2
======
- Fix keygen

0.10.1
======
- Preserve attributes on install.

0.10.0
======
- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
- Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.

0.9.7
=====
- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.

0.9.6
=====
- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds 'wheel convert [egg or wininst]' to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel

0.9.5
=====
- Wheel's own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself: 
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...`` 
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg's [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.

0.9.4
=====
- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist

0.9.3
=====
- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
- Integrated "wheel install" command (single package, no dependency
  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)

0.9.2
=====
- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes

0.9.1
=====
- 'wheel sign' uses the keys generated by 'wheel keygen' (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)

0.9
===
- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
