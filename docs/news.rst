  ``METADATA`` (PR by Anderson Bravalheri)

**0.38.3 (2022-11-08)**

- Fixed install failure when used with ``--no-binary``, reported on Ubuntu 20.04, by
  removing ``setup_requires`` from ``setup.cfg``

**0.38.2 (2022-11-05)**

- Fixed regression introduced in v0.38.1 which broke parsing of wheel file names with
  multiple platform tags

**0.38.1 (2022-11-04)**

- Removed install dependency on setuptools
- The future-proof fix in 0.36.0 for converting PyPy's SOABI into a abi tag was
  faulty. Fixed so that future changes in the SOABI will not change the tag.

**0.38.0 (2022-10-21)**

- Dropped support for Python < 3.7
- Updated vendored ``packaging`` to 21.3
- Replaced all uses of ``distutils`` with ``setuptools``
- The handling of ``license_files`` (including glob patterns and default
  values) is now delegated to ``setuptools>=57.0.0`` (#466).
  The package dependencies were updated to reflect this change.
- Fixed potential DoS attack via the ``WHEEL_INFO_RE`` regular expression
- Fixed ``ValueError: ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980`` when using
  ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0`` or when on-disk timestamps are earlier than 1980-01-01. Such
  timestamps are now changed to the minimum value before packaging.

- Fixed ``wheel pack`` duplicating the ``WHEEL`` contents when the build number has
  changed (#415)
- Fixed parsing of file names containing commas in ``RECORD`` (PR by Hood Chatham)

**0.37.0 (2021-08-09)**

**0.36.2 (2020-12-13)**

- Updated vendored ``packaging`` library to v20.8
- Fixed wheel sdist missing ``LICENSE.txt``
- Don't use default ``macos/arm64`` deployment target in calculating the
  platform tag for fat binaries (PR by Ronald Oussoren)

**0.36.1 (2020-12-04)**

- Fixed ``AssertionError`` when ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` was set to ``11``
  (PR by Grzegorz Bokota and François-Xavier Coudert)
- Fixed regression introduced in 0.36.0 on Python 2.7 when a custom generator
  name was passed as unicode (Scikit-build)
  (``TypeError: 'unicode' does not have the buffer interface``)

**0.36.0 (2020-12-01)**

- Added official Python 3.9 support
- Updated vendored ``packaging`` library to v20.7
- Switched to always using LF as line separator when generating ``WHEEL`` files
  (on Windows, CRLF was being used instead)
- The ABI tag is taken from  the sysconfig SOABI value. On PyPy the SOABI value
  is ``pypy37-pp73`` which is not compliant with PEP 3149, as it should have
  both the API tag and the platform tag. This change future-proofs any change
  in PyPy's SOABI tag to make sure only the ABI tag is used by wheel.
- Fixed regression and test for ``bdist_wheel --plat-name``. It was ignored for
  C extensions in v0.35, but the regression was not detected by tests.

**0.35.1 (2020-08-14)**

- Replaced install dependency on ``packaging`` with a vendored copy of its
  ``tags`` module

  name (it was not being converted to lowercase)

- Switched to the packaging_ library for computing wheel tags
- Fixed a resource leak in ``WheelFile.open()`` (PR by Jon Dufresne)

.. _packaging: https://pypi.org/project/packaging/

- Fixed installation of ``wheel`` from sdist on environments without Unicode
  file name support

**0.34.1 (2020-01-27)**

- Fixed installation of ``wheel`` from sdist which was broken due to a chicken
  and egg problem with PEP 517 and setuptools_scm

  (PR by Grzegorz Bokota)

  limited ABI

**0.26.0 (2015-09-18)**

- Fix multiple entrypoint comparison failure on Python 3 (Issue #148)

**0.25.0 (2015-09-16)**

- Add Python 3.5 to tox configuration
- Deterministic (sorted) metadata
- Fix tagging for Python 3.5 compatibility
- Support py2-none-'arch' and py3-none-'arch' tags
- Treat data-only wheels as pure
- Write to temporary file and rename when using wheel install --force

**0.24.0 (2014-07-06)**

- The python tag used for pure-python packages is now .pyN (major version
  only). This change actually occurred in 0.23.0 when the --python-tag
  option was added, but was not explicitly mentioned in the changelog then.
- wininst2wheel and egg2wheel removed. Use "wheel convert [archive]"
  instead.
- Wheel now supports setuptools style conditional requirements via the
  extras_require={} syntax. Separate 'extra' names from conditions using
  the : character. Wheel's own setup.py does this. (The empty-string
  extra is the same as install_requires.) These conditional requirements
  should work the same whether the package is installed by wheel or
  by setup.py.

**0.23.0 (2014-03-31)**

- Compatibility tag flags added to the bdist_wheel command
- sdist should include files necessary for tests
- 'wheel convert' can now also convert unpacked eggs to wheel
- Rename pydist.json to metadata.json to avoid stepping on the PEP
- The --skip-scripts option has been removed, and not generating scripts is now
  the default. The option was a temporary approach until installers could
  generate scripts themselves. That is now the case with pip 1.5 and later.
  Note that using pip 1.4 to install a wheel without scripts will leave the
  installation without entry-point wrappers. The "wheel install-scripts"
  command can be used to generate the scripts in such cases.
- Thank you contributors

**0.22.0 (2013-09-15)**

- Include entry_points.txt, scripts a.k.a. commands, in experimental
  pydist.json
- Improved test_requires parsing
- Python 2.6 fixes, "wheel version" command courtesy pombredanne

**0.21.0 (2013-07-20)**

- Pregenerated scripts are the default again.
- "setup.py bdist_wheel --skip-scripts" turns them off.
- setuptools is no longer a listed requirement for the 'wheel'
  package. It is of course still required in order for bdist_wheel
  to work.
- "python -m wheel" avoids importing pkg_resources until it's necessary.

**0.20.0**

- No longer include console_scripts in wheels. Ordinary scripts (shell files,
  standalone Python files) are included as usual.
- Include new command "python -m wheel install-scripts [distribution
  [distribution ...]]" to install the console_scripts (setuptools-style
  scripts using pkg_resources) for a distribution.

**0.19.0 (2013-07-19)**

- pymeta.json becomes pydist.json

**0.18.0 (2013-07-04)**

- Put the description in the newly allowed payload section of PKG-INFO
  (METADATA) files.

  headers.

**0.10.3 (2012-10-03)**

- Scripts fixer fix

**0.10.2 (2012-10-02)**

**0.10.1 (2012-09-30)**

- Preserve attributes on install.

**0.10.0 (2012-09-30)**

- Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
  that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
  pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)

  apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.

**0.9.7 (2012-09-20)**

- Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
  configuration for keygen/signing operations.

**0.9.6 (2012-09-19)**

- requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
  Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
  or just always install from wheel.
- drop dirspec requirement on win32
- improved command line utility, adds 'wheel convert [egg or wininst]' to
  convert legacy binary formats to wheel

**0.9.5 (2012-09-15)**

- Wheel's own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself:
  ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...``
- Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
  dependencies.
- Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg's [metadata] section. In addition to
  dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
  from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.

**0.9.4 (2012-09-11)**

- Fix wheel.signatures in sdist

**0.9.3 (2012-09-10)**

- Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.

  resolution) including compatibility check.
- Support Python 3.3
- Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)

**0.9.2 (2012-08-29)**

- Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
- Even more Python 3 fixes

**0.9.1 (2012-08-28)**

- 'wheel sign' uses the keys generated by 'wheel keygen' (instead of generating
  a new key at random each time)
- Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
- Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)

**0.9 (2012-08-22)**

- Updated digital signatures scheme
- Python 3 support for digital signatures
- Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
- "wheel" command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files

**0.8 (2012-08-17)**

- none/any draft pep tags update
- improved wininst2wheel script
- doc changes and other improvements

**0.7 (2012-07-28)**
